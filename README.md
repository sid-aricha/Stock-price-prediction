# Stock-price-prediction

## Overview ##

This repository contains a Python project for stock price prediction using the PyTorch deep learning framework, specifically employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Additionally, it utilizes data manipulation and visualization libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The MinMaxScaler from Scikit-Learn is used to scale the data for better LSTM training.
