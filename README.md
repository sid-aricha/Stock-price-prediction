# Stock-price-prediction

## Overview ##

This repository contains a Python project for stock price prediction using the PyTorch deep learning framework, specifically employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Additionally, it utilizes data manipulation and visualization libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The MinMaxScaler from Scikit-Learn is used to scale the data for better LSTM training. 

### Methodology 
1.Preprocessing and Cleaning

2.Feature visualization on Opening and Closing prices

3.Splitting of data

4.Data observation on each epoch

5.Analysis on Actual and predicted closing prices

### Libraries and Frameworks used
1.PyTorch

2.NumPy

3.Pandas

4.Matplotlib

5.Scikit-Learn
